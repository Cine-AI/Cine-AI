## Cine-AI

This is the repository for Cine-AI, an open-sourced procedural cinematography toolset capable of imitating real directors' styles. The repository
contains an example Unity 3D scene with a basic cut-scene that contains multiple humanoid assets having a chat in an living-room like environment.
Additionally, there are 2 example director data-sets for Quentin Tarantino & Guy Ritchie.

One can use the Cine-AI tools & features to shoot this demo scene based on the example directors' styles.
